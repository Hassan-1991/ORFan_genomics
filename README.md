Codes used for analyzing genomic data in the forthcoming manuscript, "Imported, not Invented, Genes Prevail among E. coli ORFans", uz-Zaman and Ochman.

Order in which the scripts are to be executed:

1. Preparing_databases_110925_sh.ipynb
2. Preparing_query_proteins_sh.ipynb
3. ProteinBlasts_RegularBlastn_sh.ipynb
4. Extracting_Flank_information_sh.ipynb
5. Final_searches_and_compilation_sh.ipynb
6. distribution_plot_final.ipynb

Gene categories can be extracted from the tables generated in this process. Script #6 is used to make the central figure of the paper (the pangenome distribution plot).
